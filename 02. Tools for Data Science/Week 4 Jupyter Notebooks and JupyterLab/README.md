# Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab
> With the advancement of digital data, Jupyter Notebook allows a Data Scientist to record their data experiments and results that others can reuse. This module introduces the Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab. You will learn how to work with different kernels in a Notebook session and about the basic Jupyter architecture. In addition, you will identify the tools in an Anaconda Jupyter environment. Finally, the module gives an overview of cloud based Jupyter environments and their data science features.
